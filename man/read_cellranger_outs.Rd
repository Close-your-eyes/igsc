\title{Read necessary file from 10X Genomics' cellranger output and return a concatenated data frame}
\usage{
read_cellranger_outs(vdj_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{vdj_path}{path to the parent folder containing one or multiple subfolders with cellrangers VDJ outs}
}
\value{
data frame (cl_long)
}
\description{
Caution: This function will add CDR3 sequences etc. uniformly to equal clonotype_ids even though
if e.g. TRA was detected in every cell that has been assigned with clonotype_id i.
Use read_cellranger_outs2 for a different behaviour, namely that this kind of
imputation is not performed.
}
\details{
Required files in each subfolder of vdj_path are consensus_annotations.csv, filtered_contig_annotations.csv, consensus.fasta, concat_ref.fasta, filtered_contig.fasta.
If one or more are missing this subfolder is excluded. clonotype_id and consensus_id are suffixed with _cr for cellranger; entries from consensus.fasta becomes consensus_seq_cr.
